## What is AI Search API
Creating an AI agent that can access and utilize real-time web information presents significant technical challenges.
Traditional web scraping approaches lack scalability and demand specialized knowledge to implement effectively.
Existing search engine APIs fall short by returning potentially unrelated articles rather than providing direct
answers to queries, and they aren't designed with AI agent requirements in mind.

To address these limitations, we're proud to launch AI Search API - the first search engine purpose-built for AI agents.
AI Search API delivers an LLM-optimized search experience that prioritizes speed, efficiency, and reliable results.
While conventional search APIs like Serp or Google cater to general use cases, AI Search API specifically targets
AI developers and autonomous agents. We handle the entire information pipeline - from search and scraping to
filtering and extraction - delivering the most relevant online data through a single, streamlined API call.

You can now test the API directly through our [API Playground](https://app.aisearchapi.io/playground),
